# RLVR (Modified RLBot)

See [drssoccer55's original RLBot](https://github.com/drssoccer55/RLBot) for details on how to get the RL Bot working.
The config edits here will run a match with three cars:
- you
- botserver opponent which will send game data to local port 3451 
- a normal all-star bot opponent
